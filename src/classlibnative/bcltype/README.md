# bcltype

bcltype may stand for "Base Class Library Type". You'll find a set of low level functions here. Most of them have managed implementations. They are called by managed code via `FCall`.

For `FCall` please refer to [fcall](../../vm/README.md#fcall)

Note: `FCall` functions obey certain rules. We do not bother the rules in this module. Instead we focus on the functionality of each function.
