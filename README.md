# CoreCLR Code Book
This repository contains my learning and analyzing results of CoreCLR. It intends to describe the function and purpose of each file of CoreCLR from my understanding.

The folder structure is similar as CoreCLR repository so it's easy to follow.

For each module, there's a `README.md` provides an overview of this module, which is a good entry to get started.

The detailed analysis is inline in the files.
